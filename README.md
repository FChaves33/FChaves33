### Hi there 👋  I'm Francisco Chaves

#### Doctor and Data Scientist, Portugal 🌍

The goal to make a global impact in healthcare led me to pursue knowledge and practice in the machine learning and artificial intelligence field. 

🎯  I was granted a full paid scholarship for a Data Science & Artificial Intelligence specialization at Le Wagon after pitching a project I've been developing entitled "Revolutionizing Healthcare Appointments".

🦾  I have colaborated in machine and deep learning projects such as predicting the probability of skin cancer and also in creating a machine learning model that outputs the prediction of death in patients recently admitted in Intensive Care Units.

🔑  Currently, I am completing a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare.

🚀 My ultimate goal is leveraging innovation to drive positive change in healthcare delivery.
